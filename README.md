# PerformingRobots
Welcome to Meera AlKhazraji's Performing Robots page! This project was done in partnership with Victor Nadu for the class led by Professor Michael Shiloh.

_JackPotts_ is the code we used for the robot, while _Wheels_ was used for the ... wheels. My full documentation is in my journal.
