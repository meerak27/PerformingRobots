### Entry One: Building Robot Height

**Step 0:** We started by finding the right plank of wood — cut it down to length and sanded it smooth. (I’ll add the sanding photos here!)

**Step 1:** Once ready, we placed the plank on top of the robot base and traced its outline with a pencil. Then we positioned four L-brackets, one on each side, and marked where the screw holes should go.

**Step 2:** Using a size 5 drill bit, we pre-drilled the holes and attached the brackets. That gave us a standing frame to build on.  

**Step 3:** Next, we decided to secure the bottom of the L-brackets to the base for extra stability. At first, we made a mistake — we used #5 bolts with washers instead of wood screws, and couldn’t figure out why they wouldn’t hold. After a bit of frustration, we asked Dustin for help.  

**Step 4:** Before screwing everything in place, we realized the vertical pole we cut wasn’t perfectly straight — it leaned slightly. To fix that, Dustin hand-sawed it, then took it to the scene shop and re-cut it at an angle to balance it out.

**Step 5:** With that fixed, we worked with Dustin to properly secure everything:

- Drilled small pilot holes into the base.  
- Marked their positions on the vertical pole.  
- Drilled matching holes in the pole.  
- Widened the base holes so the screws could pass through cleanly and thread only into the pole.  

Once everything lined up, we screwed it all in place - and now the full structure is standing upright!  ![059b0112-05fc-46a9-9339-97694b6f524b](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9687238e-fd8f-430c-abfe-0ad3fd0ac4da)

 **Next Step:** Test the balance and stability before adding any additional weight or components. Carve out the cardboard necessary for the body.
