# Meera AlKhazraji's Journal 
## Victor Nadu and I have collaborated on this project from start to finish. 

### Entry One: Building Robot Height
#### October 2, 2025

**Step 0:** We started by finding the right plank of wood — cut it down to length and sanded it smooth. (I’ll add the sanding photos here!)  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc43cb66-e8e2-4f06-8e44-77bbdedefcf6" width="300">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cadc348a-01a5-4182-b420-39e0a777f1c0" width="300">

**Step 1:** Once ready, we placed the plank on top of the robot base and traced its outline with a pencil. Then we positioned four L-brackets, one on each side, and marked where the screw holes should go.  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03b5c613-949d-46ba-8f79-fc88c001818c" width="300">

**Step 2:** Using a size 5 drill bit, we pre-drilled the holes and attached the brackets. That gave us a standing frame to build on.  

**Step 3:** Next, we decided to secure the bottom of the L-brackets to the base for extra stability. At first, we made a mistake — we used #5 bolts with washers instead of wood screws, and couldn’t figure out why they wouldn’t hold. After a bit of frustration, we asked Dustin for help.  

**Step 4:** Before screwing everything in place, we realized the vertical pole we cut wasn’t perfectly straight — it leaned slightly. To fix that, Dustin hand-sawed it, then took it to the scene shop and re-cut it at an angle to balance it out.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39dbef8c-9d3b-47b9-87c5-3bcdb421f26e" width="300">

**Step 5:** With that fixed, we worked with Dustin to properly secure everything:

- Drilled small pilot holes into the base.  
- Marked their positions on the vertical pole.  
- Drilled matching holes in the pole.  
- Widened the base holes so the screws could pass through cleanly and thread only into the pole.  

Once everything lined up, we screwed it all in place - and now the full structure is standing upright!  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9687238e-fd8f-430c-abfe-0ad3fd0ac4da" width="300">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05adf713-4d5c-4b40-9c30-189135bca1ae" width="300">

 **Next Step:** Test the balance and stability before adding any additional weight or components. Carve out the cardboard necessary for the body.

### Entry Two: Building the Cardboard Body
#### October 7, 2025

This session, we started building the main torso of the robot.  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4030e2e7-799f-48be-9c0a-16c6419435f3" width="300">

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2616176-57c8-4f25-b43b-f7fa4d979965" width="300">

Last class, we measured the wood and sketched out our design, we settled on a **slot machine** look. We also decided that our material would be cardboard. The main appendage will be a crank/lever. For now, it’s made of styrofoam: we hot-glued multiple styrofoam cylinders together to make a long handle and topped it with a styrofoam sphere. It’s just a placeholder for now, but we plan to revisit it later with better materials or a more creative idea. We also plan to add a few more special elements, see the photo above for reference of our inspiration.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a1bdaec-bbf2-4aee-a83c-ca71e4c6c362" width="300">

For the cardboard body, we measured and cut out the initial pieces, but balancing and attaching them was trickier than expected. Some screws and uneven spots made alignment difficult, so we adjusted the measurements and managed to secure the first panel. The other two sides took longer. It was a lot of trial and error, with multiple rounds of cutting, trimming, and tinkering until everything fit as we saw fit.  

When one piece didn’t fit, we repurposed it into smaller braces instead of wasting material. Then we cut a fresh piece of cardboard for the final panel. Since this was our first time working with cardboard, we learned a few helpful tricks along the way.  

After getting the main panels up, we hot-glued the sides and base, we then added several internal braces for extra support. By the end, the frame felt solid and stable.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ad032fb-1be7-40f7-8265-5636fe20e085" width="300">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28539559-421b-4334-bfba-6d10e986e0e6" width="300">

Next, we needed a wood plank for the servo motor. Since the scene shop was closed, we found spare wood blocks in the IM lab, hand-sawed a piece to size, and attached it with **Fevicol**. We clamped it down overnight to let it set properly.  

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/412bb8d8-4637-4e00-8b8e-7ad9b1e3aefa" width="300">

We also cut a slit in the back though we will likely have to widen it to make it easier to reach inside and see through.

**Next Step:** Check if the wood block set securely, widen the back slot, and attach the servo motor and crank.

### Entry Three: Servo and Crank Prototyping
#### October 7, 2025
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9aa82d9-9b57-42b5-b967-55ba5d9c144e" width="300">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc6e7173-304a-4ec5-94f7-4cd5bafd8fc4" width="300">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17858681-4aa3-4c80-96aa-b4634055e725" width="300">

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6c81a39-9b8d-4ee3-b66b-891839c2df8b" width="300">

Thankfully, the wood block set well, and we widened the back slot. With that done, we started attaching the servo motor and the crank. We faced struggles with the servo extenders and had to alternate between several options before finding one that worked. Since we did not yet have a final crank design, we created a temporary version using small styrofoam cylinders hot-glued together, topped with a styrofoam sphere. After discussing this with the professor, we added a cut-open water bottle piece so it could attach to the servo horn. Our first attempt involved using a single screw through the bottle cap, which failed. We then added a second screw on the top left to improve balance and secured the entire thing with tape. It was a temporary solution, meant only for testing the shape and movement before committing to a permanent design. We mounted the Arduino Mega onto the wood plank and tested the servo motors. We had issues with the battery, so we powered everything using a power bank. The servo test finally worked, and we recorded a video of the first successful movement. (The mounting tape would be used to mount the neopixels, so it thankfully wasnt purchased in vain!)


### Entry Four: Permanent Crank and Upper Body Construction
#### October 21-23, 2025
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e818742-356b-4448-941e-6629b8c47a67" width="300">

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e724a923-b281-4b55-beb6-5dc8f3ac0ca5" width="300">

We replaced the temporary crank with a more permanent mechanism. In the IM lab, we found metal rods and drilled holes into them. We painted the styrofoam red to match the typical lever look. We bent an L-bracket to the angle we wanted and attached one side of it to the servo motor, with the other side supporting the metal rod. This process took longer than expected and required several failed attempts, but the final result worked as intended. We wrapped the metal rod in aluminum foil to give it a shiny look on stage. I also learned that to drill metal, we have to use an HSS tip, which is useful knowledge. We continued working on the upper section of the robot. Originally, the top formed a single triangle, but we realized we needed a flat top to place the light later on. We rebuilt it with two sloped sides and a flat surface in the center. The next day, we adjusted the servo motor alignment because the previous configuration was not functioning correctly. Once fixed, the crank operated smoothly.

### Entry Five: NeoPixels and Light Housing
#### October 23-25, 2025
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ae572c7-99ba-497c-aa0a-06ace8870e72" width="300">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f850b2c-1868-4935-b71b-6d7928a6c086" width="300">
At this point, the robot’s body was complete, and the servo mechanism worked consistently. We moved on to coding and installing the NeoPixels, which worked on the first test. To mount the diffused light dome, we found a frosted glass-like bowl that produced a good diffusion effect. The professor suggested attaching it using a pipe and wood plank. We cut the plank in the scene shop, sawed the pipe to the correct length, and secured the pieces using L-brackets. We attached the mount to the cardboard body using wood glue and clamped it overnight. We also replaced the broken battery during this stage. The next step was to fully secure the light dome and begin preparing for the rotating reels of the slot machine.


### Entry Six: Designing the Slot Machine Reels
#### October 28-29, 2025
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc1a3059-63ed-4b21-9f1e-e18da429ee82" width="300">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36928d88-d50c-42b9-82ee-884f6c884b1f" width="300">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50ea3a9b-8573-4fad-ba64-4a0f110ed987" width="300">

We began planning the three rotating reels for the slot-machine section. The professor gave us a stepper motor with a rod attachment that would drive the rotation. We tested hexagon and octagon shapes and made several cardboard prototypes by hand. Since we needed six identical shapes, we decided laser cutting would provide more accuracy. We designed the shapes and attempted to cut them, but the laser cutter gave an error when cutting the connecting piece. During this downtime, we refined the measurements and tested the prototype hexagons for general fit and size. We decided on six uniform hexagons for the reel structure and continued refining the design.


### Entry Seven: Circular Reel Structure and Rastering
#### October 30, 2025
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f294eb8-69c7-4203-9b27-efa3332727e0" width="300">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/002b7708-769c-45fd-b165-9ddae3d77a39" width="300">

We returned to the lab to find a better reel design because the hexagons did not have equal sides and the laser cutter error interrupted the process. While troubleshooting, Dustin suggested another approach: creating six circular pieces with rastered triangular sections that would allow the cardstock to bend around them. We opted for this method. The triangles gave the circular pieces flexibility, so the heavy cardboard-style paper could wrap smoothly around the form. These circular forms fit well into the slot-machine opening and aligned with the stepper motor system.


### Entry Eight: NeoPixel Mounting, Front Cutout, and Stepper Motor Work
#### November 2-5, 2025
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbc40800-44e5-4649-aa23-7dab808c3da6" width="300">

We added mounting strip tape to the back of the NeoPixels and wrapped them around the pole. After securing them, we cleaned up the cable management and attached the frosted dome on top. The lighting looked correct once installed. Next, we cut the front opening of the robot. This cutout is where the three reels will slightly protrude when the stepper motor turns them. We adjusted the cutout to ensure it was large enough for visibility and movement. We began experimenting with ways to mount the stepper motor. Our first attempt involved attaching wood planks to the sides. I cut several planks in the scene shop, and we adjusted some of them with the hand saw in the lab. After discussing with the professor and Dustin, we realized this was not the best solution. The professor recommended creating a shelf structure instead, which we will work on next. In the meantime, we focused on attaching the circular reel pieces to the stepper motor. Because of the stoppers on the rod, we needed a way to secure the reel forms while still allowing access for tightening. We tried alternating patterns at first, but Dustin recommended using grub screws for a cleaner and more reliable connection. This allowed us to widen the central hole and attach the circular forms securely while maintaining minimal spacing between reels. After making these changes, we attached all six circular panels to the stepper motor shaft. The remaining task is to wrap them in the heavy cardboard-style paper and finalize the artwork. We are deciding whether to use traditional Las Vegas symbols or incorporate imagery connected to the script we are working with. The next steps include designing the reel graphics, building the shelf structure for the stepper motor, and brainstorming an additional feature such as a dispenser. We plan to finalize this brainstorming by the end of Thursday.

### Entry Nine: Shelf Construction for the Reels 
### November 6–7

We made a cutout in the front of the robot where the reels will eventually sit. I cut a large rectangular opening in the cardboard with enough clearance for the rotating reels to be visible and accessible. Before this, I had already cut several pieces of wood with a completely different mounting idea in mind, but after discussing with Dustin, I quickly realized my original plan would be weak and cause alot of balance issues. The professor and I brainstormed alternative structures, and we decided a shelf design would be more secure. We prototyped on paper, then went to the scene shop to cut the wood planks for the shelf. After cutting the wood to size, I mounted the shelf by attaching three L-brackets to the main vertical wooden plank that runs from the base to the top. I then drilled holes on both sides of the shelf to support the DC motor. This gave us a sturdy base for the motor. To make this easier during testing, I also cut openings on the sides of the front of the cardboard body so the dc motor can easily be taken in and out. 
During rehearsal the next day, we discovered a major issue: the robot had significant balance problems and was close to tipping over various times. We did not yet have the code or movement fully tuned, so from this point forward we focused a main priority was the robots stability which we will later address on the code and and in the fabrication.

### Entry Ten: Adding the Caster Wheel, Prototyping Shield, and Power Issues 
### November 10–14

[cases demo]([url](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NXZ6YmgtkAqCHvUBDg4O09I4oM1MH2kT/view?usp=sharing))

Because the robot had a ‘top-heavy’ balance and was unstable, we decided to add a second caster wheel on the back. The scene shop was closed, so I used the scraps in the IM lab + the wood planks for the original shelf idea I had to prototype the position. I used clamps to make sure the caster did not touch the ground unless the robot leaned too far back. Once the alignment felt right, I bolted everything down.

Aswell, I worked with the professor to add the prototyping shield for the dc motor. We soldered headers, screw terminals, resistors, and several cables needed for the DC motor, and at that point we believed the soldering was complete (will revisit this in the next entry).

When I started writing the cases, I realized the neopixels were drawing a lot of power. This caused the servo motor to shake uncontrollably, and the shaking detached the pole we had mounted on the servo horn. To deal with this, I added code that detaches the servo motor when it is not needed and only reattaches it when a case requires movement. This helped reduce power strain, but I still need to discuss with the professor the best long-term method to stabilize the power draw. Because of these issues, the professor and Victor worked closely to reinforce the attachment between the pole and the servo motor. The ball on top of the pipe, which is part of the crank mechanism, also kept falling off, so Victor and I are still considering better ways to secure it.

The next work session focused on imporoving the transmitter controls. Victor tuned the parameters for the servo motor until the motion became smooth. I was also able to control the neopixels and trigger lines from the script using the transmitter. This part took a significant learning curve, but once I understood it, everything worked reliably. By the end of this stage, I could control the main elements of the robot: the voice, the servo motor, and the neopixels. We still need to figure out how best to secure the speaker as its still not fully secured properly.

We then had rehearsals, we were continuing to troubleshoot the robot balance before and after rehearsals. Even after refining the code for acceleration and deceleration, the robot still had stability issue which thankfully after the rehearsal we improved  by about 90% by improving the code and tightening the nuts on the wheels on the bottom.  During rehearsal, a major problem occurred when we stacked the prototyping shield on top of the music maker shield. The DC motor immediately started running uncontrollably, breaking one of the cardboard panels (for the reel) and bending several of the solder brackets. We discovered this happened because we had forgotten an additional resistor. After adding it, the problem stopped, and we wrapped up the day.


### Entry Eleven: Weekend Work and Reel Decoration 
### November 14–16
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e3cb891-df91-4f1f-9fb7-8d6f2e7b81af" width="300">

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1d38fe0-7c38-448e-8de7-047a87c72000" width="300">

We planned the decoration for the reels and initially ordered glitter paper to cover them. The size was wrong, so we attempted another solution, but we were not happy with how it looked when the reels were still. We will test how it appears while spinning and decide whether to redo it after seeing it in motion. We also designed fifteen unique symbols for the reels using AI. Each reel will have five symbols. We are turning these designs into holographic stickers so they can stand out on stage. The stickers should be ready on Monday.

We also finalized the robot’s voice and generated much more spoken lines. We also added the initial DC motor code to run the reels to tested that all is finally working as it should be with it.  The remaining tasks are to write the final integrated code with all the cases (which we now know hwo to do, we just need to address the power issue), turn all script lines into text-to-speech, stick the symbols to the reels, adjust the decoration on the reels and the robots exterior.

### Entry Twelve: Coding the Cases and Preparing the Reels
### November 18-19
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/962b1e08-6cef-4660-868c-505920574851" width="300">

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53fced43-b1c7-4d52-8cc3-91c67c093e9e" width="300">

At this stage, we had the code for the cases and the dialogue lines [completed]([url](https://youtu.be/KqF-X0SrsKw)), and we were happy with how everything was flowing. The motor and reels were not yet connected to the robot because we were still unhappy with the look of the reels and the speed, which we planned to address later. At this point the holographic stickers for the reels arrived and we found all the wallpaper we need to decorate the robot. We decided on a fake wood looking sticker for the side and a shiny silver for the front while the reels will be a shiny pink. 

During this stage, we also ran into a few issues while setting up the cases. The NeoPixels drew a lot of power, which caused the servo motor to jerk randomly. To reduce the load and prevent constant shaking, we added the attach–detach logic so the servo only activates when needed. Since the servo kept jerking, we also worked on making the physical attachment between the crank mechanism and the servo horn sturdier so the structure would be more durable. We continued refining both the code and the structure, aiming to keep the overall movement smooth and consistent.


### Entry Thirteen: Re-Cutting the Reels and Adding the Faster Motor
### November 21
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8897d771-c1e3-4755-901a-86d67774ced3" width="300">

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f91f4b0c-6019-4380-ad30-d69926599d57" width="300">

Because we were not satisfied with how the reels looked, we decided to laser cut them again and rebuild the structure. We also wanted a quicker motor, so we got a faster one and attached it. The new motor was much larger than expected, which caused sizing issues, but we resolved it by making a cutout on the side of the robot and deciding that we would cover it late. 

Around this time, we also faced issues with the audio not playing properly and with the transmitter. The professor is working on a fix for the audio problem. We believe we have addressed the transmitter issue, but both areas will require further testing before we can be certain everything is stable. 

### Entry Fourteen: Robot Progress Update
### November 23
From the list of the five remaining items: the audio issue, decoration, drum, faster motor, and wire management. Over the weekend we reprinted the drums as planned and attached them to the rod, and the motor issue was solved by switching to the faster motor. Wire management should not be a major concern since zip ties were our best-friends as we worked.

The two remaining tasks are the audio issue and the decoration. On Monday, we will correct the sizing of the drums then decorate it. On Wednesday, we will decorate the full robot. We already have all the materials we need, but because the robot is very tall and requires two people to work on it, Wednesday is the only day we are both available. We still need to finalize the audio issue, but since we think the transmitter problem has been solved, we will test the audio system again and see how it behaves on Monday or Tuesday. 

We also adjusted our code for the wheels as we were happy with the smoothness but the backwards movement still slightly jerked so we will have to test that out, which we will do on Monday. As well, after the rehearsal we realized we dont have enough stage time so we will adjust the scene where the attorneys clash on Monday. The whole class agreed to have about 14-15 lines per character, so we will discuss with the wife's attorney team (Ghader and Mustafa) to decide how best to remake the scene and consider either making it a clash or a conversation.

We spent this session redecorating the reels and drilling new holes in the shelf to accommodate the updated structure. Decorating the reels took much longer than expected, but as we continued working, we found a method that made the process more consistent and manageable. By the end, we were happy with how they looked, it honestly wasn't perfect, but we realized this is the best we would be able to get, and we are okay with the imperfections for now. When we went to attach the decorated reels to the bracket connected to the motor, the fit was incorrect. We removed the bracket, and then reattached it to the shelf. After powering the system, [only the motor was working (see demo]([url](https://youtu.be/QX0EPyKBajg)), while the reels themselves did not move. We will troubleshoot and find a solution next session with the professor.
Aside from the mechanical work, I also updated Scene 3 to improve the flow and give the robot more lines. With the updated script, we now need to recode the cases and regenerate the corresponding audio before Thursdays rehearsal.

### Entry Sixteen: Decoration and Reinforcement

In this session, we focused on decorating the sides and the front of the robot. For the sides, we used a black wood-pattern material, and for the front we used a shiny silver one. We peeled and stuck everything into place, but we intentionally left the top half of the right section undecorated. That area holds the motor, and since we still need to address the motor issue, we decided to keep it as cardboard for now so we do not create extra trouble cutting through decoration later.

During rehearsals, we also noticed a stability problem with the top section of the robot. The NeoPixel housing sits on top of a piece of wood mounted onto the cardboard, and the entire structure was heavier than expected. It was not reinforced as well as it needed to be, so it would sometimes wobble. We prepared to strengthen it using cardboard gussets, but then realized we had a few leftover wood blocks from prototyping. One of them was almost the perfect length, so we used L-brackets to attach it directly to the tall vertical plank of wood that gives the robot its height. We then used wood glue to secure the block against the cardboard. This made the top significantly more stable, and we felt much more comfortable with its structure.

We also revisited the audio issue. The professor suggested a fix: ensure the music maker shield is not playing anything before triggering a new file. If it is playing, stop it first, and then play the next file. After adding that to the code, the audio issue disappeared [(see demo)]([url](https://youtube.com/shorts/QVTzN6wfbb0)). We will continue testing and testing this to ensure it doesn't randomly appear again, but it should be okay for now. 

### Entry Seventeen: Cases and Script
### November 26
Today we finalized our play script and made sure we were fully happy with the lines. We generated all the audio files and wrote the updated code and cases to match the finalized dialogue. In tomorrow’s rehearsal, we plan to test everything together, make sure the flow feels right, and then adjust the colors, timing, tones, or any other details that need refinement. We also hope to have some time to addresss the motor issue tomorrow. 

### Entry Eighteen: Motor Fixes and Front Decoration
### November 27

We spent this session fixing the motor and beginning to design stickers for the front of the robot, since it still looked empty. The motor was not fitting correctly and was not spinning the reels, so we realized we needed to adjust the shelf. This meant cutting the shelf itself, widening the gap, and reshaping the area so the motor could sit correctly and the reels could spin without friction. While making these adjustments, we also realized we needed to refine the code again. There were a few small bugs, and some of the color choices in the lighting did not look the way we wanted. We made the necessary updates and prepared to test everything after rehearsal.


### Entry Nineteen: Post-Rehearsal Adjustments
### November 28

After rehearsal, we saw that the NeoPixel lighting still was not expressive enough, and the robot overall did not feel as lively as we wanted. The professor suggested adjusting the motor speed so the movement could better match the emotion or energy of each case, and we decided to implement that. We also continued refining the shelf. We had to cut it more than expected, and the professor helped by taking several trips to the scene shop to get the exact cuts we needed. We widened the gap in multiple stages and finally reached a configuration that worked reliably for both the [motor and the reels]([url](https://youtu.be/y9D4M84iITM)). We will now be able to finish decorating the side of the robot and adding the stickers to the reels. 


### Entry Twenty: Weekend Work and Increasing Expressiveness
### November 29-31
Last class, we discussed adding additional NeoPixel strips to make the robot more expressive, and we began implementing that. We are adding new strips to the front and sides of the robot to give it more visual presence during the performance. We also implemented the updated motor speed control, adjusting the rotation speed per case so the robot’s behavior changes depending on the moment. The lighting effects were also adjusted; instead of using solid colors, we changed the patterns so they shift more dynamically and support the mood of each scene. What's remaining is to test all of these code adjustments & put all the stickers on the robot.


### Entry Twenty-One: NeoPixel Strips and Reel Updates
### Decemeber 2-4

In this session, my teammate worked closely with the professor to add the new NeoPixel strips to the robot. Once they were attached, I added the corresponding code and tested all the lighting functions. There were a few hiccups with the new effects that we figured out then everything worked as we [intended]([url](https://youtu.be/U0-pfUWAg5I)). We had just one minor issue which is that the first 2-3 cases dont rurn on the dc motor but we thinkw e figured out a solution we just have to test it. We also finished designing and printing the new stickers. Later in the session we began attaching the stickers onto the reels. Once all of them were applied, the reels looked as we intended and the decoration was consistent with our original plan. We still need to add the stickers to the front of the robot which we will do in the next session. When it was time to move the robots out for [rehearsal]([url](https://youtube.com/shorts/Tcu3pqmJTfU)), we noticed a new issue with the motor. Only one wheel was spinning, and even that wheel worked only part of the time. The professor suggested switching to more reliable slower motors, and we will do that in the next session. There was also an empty section on the side of the robot that we had left undecorated because we were still adjusting the DC motor and servo motor. Since those parts were now at a stable stage, we covered that section as well and decided to also decorate the back. Next session, we will update the idle sw5 state to fully turn everyhting on rather than being rainbow, we will add a sound when it acitvates, fix the motors for the wheels, and double check that the dc motor not spinning int he first few cases is resolved.
