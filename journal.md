## Entry One: Building Robot Height
#### October 2, 2025

**Step 0:** We started by finding the right plank of wood — cut it down to length and sanded it smooth. (I’ll add the sanding photos here!)

**Step 1:** Once ready, we placed the plank on top of the robot base and traced its outline with a pencil. Then we positioned four L-brackets, one on each side, and marked where the screw holes should go.

**Step 2:** Using a size 5 drill bit, we pre-drilled the holes and attached the brackets. That gave us a standing frame to build on.  

**Step 3:** Next, we decided to secure the bottom of the L-brackets to the base for extra stability. At first, we made a mistake — we used #5 bolts with washers instead of wood screws, and couldn’t figure out why they wouldn’t hold. After a bit of frustration, we asked Dustin for help.  

**Step 4:** Before screwing everything in place, we realized the vertical pole we cut wasn’t perfectly straight — it leaned slightly. To fix that, Dustin hand-sawed it, then took it to the scene shop and re-cut it at an angle to balance it out.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39dbef8c-9d3b-47b9-87c5-3bcdb421f26e" width="300">

**Step 5:** With that fixed, we worked with Dustin to properly secure everything:

- Drilled small pilot holes into the base.  
- Marked their positions on the vertical pole.  
- Drilled matching holes in the pole.  
- Widened the base holes so the screws could pass through cleanly and thread only into the pole.  

Once everything lined up, we screwed it all in place - and now the full structure is standing upright!  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9687238e-fd8f-430c-abfe-0ad3fd0ac4da" width="300">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05adf713-4d5c-4b40-9c30-189135bca1ae" width="300">

 **Next Step:** Test the balance and stability before adding any additional weight or components. Carve out the cardboard necessary for the body.

## Entry Two: Building the Cardboard Body
#### October 7, 2025

This session, we started building the main torso of the robot.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2616176-57c8-4f25-b43b-f7fa4d979965" width="300">

Last class, we measured the wood and sketched out our design, we settled on a **slot machine** look. We also decided that our material would be cardboard. The main appendage will be a crank/lever. For now, it’s made of styrofoam: we hot-glued multiple styrofoam cylinders together to make a long handle and topped it with a styrofoam sphere. It’s just a placeholder for now, but we plan to revisit it later with better materials or a more creative idea. We also plan to add a few more special elements, see the photo above for reference of our inspiration.

For the cardboard body, we measured and cut out the initial pieces, but balancing and attaching them was trickier than expected. Some screws and uneven spots made alignment difficult, so we adjusted the measurements and managed to secure the first panel. The other two sides took longer. It was a lot of trial and error, with multiple rounds of cutting, trimming, and tinkering until everything fit as we saw fit.  

When one piece didn’t fit, we repurposed it into smaller braces instead of wasting material. Then we cut a fresh piece of cardboard for the final panel. Since this was our first time working with cardboard, we learned a few helpful tricks along the way.  

After getting the main panels up, we hot-glued the sides and base, we then added several internal braces for extra support. By the end, the frame felt solid and stable.

Next, we needed a wood plank for the servo motor. Since the scene shop was closed, we found spare wood blocks in the IM lab, hand-sawed a piece to size, and attached it with **Fevicol**. We clamped it down overnight to let it set properly.  

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/412bb8d8-4637-4e00-8b8e-7ad9b1e3aefa" width="300">

We also cut a slit in the back though we will likely have to widen it to make it easier to reach inside and see through.

**Next Step:** Check if the wood block set securely, widen the back slot, and attach the servo motor and crank.

### Entry Three: Servo and Crank Prototyping
#### October 7, 2025

Thankfully, the wood block set well, and we widened the back slot. With that done, we started attaching the servo motor and the crank. We faced struggles with the servo extenders and had to alternate between several options before finding one that worked. Since we did not yet have a final crank design, we created a temporary version using small styrofoam cylinders hot-glued together, topped with a styrofoam sphere. After discussing this with the professor, we added a cut-open water bottle piece so it could attach to the servo horn. Our first attempt involved using a single screw through the bottle cap, which failed. We then added a second screw on the top left to improve balance and secured the entire thing with tape. It was a temporary solution, meant only for testing the shape and movement before committing to a permanent design. We mounted the Arduino Mega onto the wood plank and tested the servo motors. We had issues with the battery, so we powered everything using a power bank. The servo test finally worked, and we recorded a video of the first successful movement. (The mounting tape would be used to mount the neopixels, so it thankfully wasnt purchased in vain!)


### Entry Four: Permanent Crank and Upper Body Construction
#### October 21-23, 2025

We replaced the temporary crank with a more permanent mechanism. In the IM lab, we found metal rods and drilled holes into them. We painted the styrofoam red to match the typical lever look. We bent an L-bracket to the angle we wanted and attached one side of it to the servo motor, with the other side supporting the metal rod. This process took longer than expected and required several failed attempts, but the final result worked as intended. We wrapped the metal rod in aluminum foil to give it a shiny look on stage. I also learned that to drill metal, we have to use an HSS tip, which is useful knowledge. We continued working on the upper section of the robot. Originally, the top formed a single triangle, but we realized we needed a flat top to place the light later on. We rebuilt it with two sloped sides and a flat surface in the center. The next day, we adjusted the servo motor alignment because the previous configuration was not functioning correctly. Once fixed, the crank operated smoothly.

### Entry Five: NeoPixels and Light Housing
#### October 23-25, 2025
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ae572c7-99ba-497c-aa0a-06ace8870e72" width="300">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f850b2c-1868-4935-b71b-6d7928a6c086" width="300">
At this point, the robot’s body was complete, and the servo mechanism worked consistently. We moved on to coding and installing the NeoPixels, which worked on the first test. To mount the diffused light dome, we found a frosted glass-like bowl that produced a good diffusion effect. The professor suggested attaching it using a pipe and wood plank. We cut the plank in the scene shop, sawed the pipe to the correct length, and secured the pieces using L-brackets. We attached the mount to the cardboard body using wood glue and clamped it overnight. We also replaced the broken battery during this stage. The next step was to fully secure the light dome and begin preparing for the rotating reels of the slot machine.


### Entry Six: Designing the Slot Machine Reels
#### October 28-29, 2025
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc1a3059-63ed-4b21-9f1e-e18da429ee82" width="300">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36928d88-d50c-42b9-82ee-884f6c884b1f" width="300">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50ea3a9b-8573-4fad-ba64-4a0f110ed987" width="300">

We began planning the three rotating reels for the slot-machine section. The professor gave us a stepper motor with a rod attachment that would drive the rotation. We tested hexagon and octagon shapes and made several cardboard prototypes by hand. Since we needed six identical shapes, we decided laser cutting would provide more accuracy. We designed the shapes and attempted to cut them, but the laser cutter gave an error when cutting the connecting piece. During this downtime, we refined the measurements and tested the prototype hexagons for general fit and size. We decided on six uniform hexagons for the reel structure and continued refining the design.


### Entry Seven: Circular Reel Structure and Rastering
#### October 30, 2025
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f294eb8-69c7-4203-9b27-efa3332727e0" width="300">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/002b7708-769c-45fd-b165-9ddae3d77a39" width="300">

We returned to the lab to find a better reel design because the hexagons did not have equal sides and the laser cutter error interrupted the process. While troubleshooting, Dustin suggested another approach: creating six circular pieces with rastered triangular sections that would allow the cardstock to bend around them. We opted for this method. The triangles gave the circular pieces flexibility, so the heavy cardboard-style paper could wrap smoothly around the form. These circular forms fit well into the slot-machine opening and aligned with the stepper motor system.


### Entry Eight: NeoPixel Mounting, Front Cutout, and Stepper Motor Work
#### November 2-5, 2025

We added mounting strip tape to the back of the NeoPixels and wrapped them around the pole. After securing them, we cleaned up the cable management and attached the frosted dome on top. The lighting looked correct once installed. Next, we cut the front opening of the robot. This cutout is where the three reels will slightly protrude when the stepper motor turns them. We adjusted the cutout to ensure it was large enough for visibility and movement. We began experimenting with ways to mount the stepper motor. Our first attempt involved attaching wood planks to the sides. I cut several planks in the scene shop, and we adjusted some of them with the hand saw in the lab. After discussing with the professor and Dustin, we realized this was not the best solution. The professor recommended creating a shelf structure instead, which we will work on next. In the meantime, we focused on attaching the circular reel pieces to the stepper motor. Because of the stoppers on the rod, we needed a way to secure the reel forms while still allowing access for tightening. We tried alternating patterns at first, but Dustin recommended using grub screws for a cleaner and more reliable connection. This allowed us to widen the central hole and attach the circular forms securely while maintaining minimal spacing between reels. After making these changes, we attached all six circular panels to the stepper motor shaft. The remaining task is to wrap them in the heavy cardboard-style paper and finalize the artwork. We are deciding whether to use traditional Las Vegas symbols or incorporate imagery connected to the script we are working with. The next steps include designing the reel graphics, building the shelf structure for the stepper motor, and brainstorming an additional feature such as a dispenser. We plan to finalize this brainstorming by the end of Thursday.
