### Entry One: Building Robot Height
#### October 2, 2025

**Step 0:** We started by finding the right plank of wood — cut it down to length and sanded it smooth. (I’ll add the sanding photos here!)

**Step 1:** Once ready, we placed the plank on top of the robot base and traced its outline with a pencil. Then we positioned four L-brackets, one on each side, and marked where the screw holes should go.

**Step 2:** Using a size 5 drill bit, we pre-drilled the holes and attached the brackets. That gave us a standing frame to build on.  

**Step 3:** Next, we decided to secure the bottom of the L-brackets to the base for extra stability. At first, we made a mistake — we used #5 bolts with washers instead of wood screws, and couldn’t figure out why they wouldn’t hold. After a bit of frustration, we asked Dustin for help.  

**Step 4:** Before screwing everything in place, we realized the vertical pole we cut wasn’t perfectly straight — it leaned slightly. To fix that, Dustin hand-sawed it, then took it to the scene shop and re-cut it at an angle to balance it out.

**Step 5:** With that fixed, we worked with Dustin to properly secure everything:

- Drilled small pilot holes into the base.  
- Marked their positions on the vertical pole.  
- Drilled matching holes in the pole.  
- Widened the base holes so the screws could pass through cleanly and thread only into the pole.  

Once everything lined up, we screwed it all in place - and now the full structure is standing upright!  ![059b0112-05fc-46a9-9339-97694b6f524b](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9687238e-fd8f-430c-abfe-0ad3fd0ac4da)

 **Next Step:** Test the balance and stability before adding any additional weight or components. Carve out the cardboard necessary for the body.

### Entry Two: Building the Cardboard Body
#### October 7, 2025

This session, we started building the main torso of the robot.

Last class, we measured the wood and sketched out our design — we decided on a **slot machine** look. The main appendage will be a crank/lever. For now, it’s made of styrofoam: we hot-glued multiple styrofoam cylinders together to make a long handle and topped it with a styrofoam sphere. It’s just a placeholder for now, but we plan to revisit it later with better materials or a more creative idea.

For the **cardboard body**, we measured and cut out the initial pieces, but balancing and attaching them was trickier than expected. Some screws and uneven spots made alignment difficult, so we adjusted the measurements and managed to secure the first panel. The other two sides took longer — it was a lot of trial and error, with multiple rounds of cutting, trimming, and tinkering until everything fit as we saw fit.  

When one piece didn’t fit, we repurposed it into smaller braces instead of wasting material. Then we cut a fresh piece of cardboard for the final panel. Since this was our first time working with cardboard, we learned a few helpful tricks along the way.  

After getting the main panels up, we **hot-glued the base** and added several internal braces for extra support. By the end, the frame felt solid and stable.

Next, we needed a wood plank for the servo motor. Since the scene shop was closed, we found spare wood blocks in the IM lab, hand-sawed a piece to size, and attached it with **Fevicol**. We **clamped it down overnight** to let it set properly.  
![IMG_9610](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/412bb8d8-4637-4e00-8b8e-7ad9b1e3aefa)
We also cut a slit in the back though next time, we’ll widen it to make it easier to reach inside and see through.

**Next Step:** Check if the wood block set securely, widen the back slot, and attach the servo motor and crank.
